# Shaken and Stirred
[Video Demo](https://youtu.be/Ri9KZlfe-Gk)
A cosy game where you mix drinks at a bar for customers. Simple!

## Usage
Use the mouse to select ingredients for your drink based on the customer's request. There is an in-game recipe book to teach you how to create the drinks!

## Purpose
My 2nd year university project was to create an indie game. I was inspired by an event from [Genshin Impact](https://youtu.be/KPjtkhWGYQ0?t=10), [Coffee Talk](https://store.steampowered.com/app/914800/Coffee_Talk/), and old flash games where you have to cook food for a customer.

## Status
Finished. If I were to update this game, I would fix the resolution to work on multiple screen sizes, perhaps change it for mobile users. I would also add customers with faces, to increase immersion, and have a day system based on amount of customers served and time taken to serve them.
A potential addition to this would be making some customers request a drink based on the ingredients and making the player decide which drink would best suit them. I could also add to the immersion by making the player have to pour ingredients to a certain amount, shake the drink, place the garnish themselves etc. Cooking Mama style!
I could also add keyboard controls as an alternative input, for players who prefer keyboard over mouse.
Minor graphical updates would be made, such as recreating the art to a higher standard and making the icons stand out more against the background.
<h6>I have lost the original game files so I would have to start this game from scratch to update it.</h6>
